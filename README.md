# Learning how to create Cacti-graphs

This is a brief tour guide to explain to you how to create **cacti-graphs**

# Cacti

First, we need to understand what **cacti** is. Cacti is an open-source tool for monitoring systems (servers and network in real-time) where you can *analyze*, *interpret*, and *control* different env variables by visual charts. 

Cacti collects data through multiple methods and creates templates with advanced graphs with which you can obtain visual reports of data such as temperature, speed, voltage, number of impressions, etc.

# Create graphs

There are 2 ways to create graphs, but I will simplify the easier path:

## Easy way

- Click on ***create***
- Click on ***new graphs***
	- List with 3 options
		- You must mark all of then
- Click on ***create***

In case you are trying to create graphs inside of the mark:

- Click on ***data consult***
	- Appears 2 ways:
		- **SNMP** (Interface Statitics), where you can do data query debugging.
		- Selection by graphs type, when there is more than 1 type and is optional.
- Click on ***create***
